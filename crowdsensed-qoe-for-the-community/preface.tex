\section*{Preface}


\textit{This position paper was originally written in 2017, but never published. We think, the idea to engage the community in crowdsensing with easy-to-understand and practical information without burdening them has even increased in merit today, and we strife to continue this work in the future.} 

\textit{Therefore, we wanted to preserve this work in the form it was originally prepared in 2017, with updated affiliations, restored links, and this preface. Past reviewers of this manuscript mostly criticized the small scale of this study and the lack of details and evaluation with regards to the bandwidth estimation, the QoE model, and the geographical visualization. Reviewers positively noted the idea to disseminate easily interpretable information from science to citizens in a decentralized approach.}
